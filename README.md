# Computational Fabrication (3D Printing) - Course Project	

I am passionate about 3D Printing, so i decided to give it a try!

This repo contains all the projects I participated in CS581 Computational Fabrication during 2019 Spring at BU.

By May I am going to finish a complete 3D Printing project, which includes the design of an object using CAD software, and print it out using the Form2 3D printer and resins they provide.

# Projects

## 1. Voxelizer
It is a warm-up coding assignment. I used <b>C++</b> and built a voxelizer, which you can use to convert a 3D model(.obj) into its voxelized form. Samples and outputs are also provided!

Please refer to the wikipedia link for details.

## 2. Computational Linkage Design and Simulation

It is my second coding assignment using <b>MATLAB</b>. Mainly focuses on the mechanical structures: linkages. 

Please refer to the wikipedia link for corresponding mechanisms.
