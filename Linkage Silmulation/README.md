This folder contains my second coding assignment, that is, to design and simulate four different linkage mechanism as shown below with the help of <b>MATLAB</b>.

## General Idea

A linkage is an assembly of bodies connected to manage forces and movement. In this assignment you will design some cool linkages. We’ll be only looking at kinematics and ignore forces, and furthermore, we’ll limit ourselves to 2D planar structures with revolute joints. Provided with this assignment is a fully functional Matlab code for simulating linkages. In this assignment you will be responsible for:

1. Modifying the code to allow oscillatory driver input (instead of rotational)
2. Designing several linkages

## Run the code

1. Copy linkage.m to the working_dir you specified after the installation of MATLAB
2. Open Matlab, go to the command window and execute the following commands.
3. \>> cd working_dir
4. For the drag-link linkage, execute: \>> linkages(1)
5. For the double-rocker linkage, execute: \>> linkages(2)
6. For the Peaucellier-Lipkin linkage, execute: \>> linkages(3)
7. For the Klann linkage, execute: \>> linkages(4)
